<h1>Disclaimer</h1>
<li>This project is an assignment made by my school, Noroff.</li>
<li>The HTML & CSS for this website is used for visuals only and is made for my first ever assignment at Noroff, therefore there are countless improvements to be made.</li>
<li>I would like to improve the website and learn new technologies, for now, I am only using it for the visuals and practicing JavaScript interactions.</li>

<h2>Brief</h2>
Create an interactive online store to display product from an API endpoint. Use one of the three provided API urls to display products in HTML and allow users to create a basket of items.

You may use your existing cross course project code as a starting point, or start a fresh project if this is not available. We recommend using an existing project as styling will not be graded, but is nice to have in the final submission.
